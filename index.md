I am Rachit, a PhD student at Harvard University advised by [Prof. David Alvarez-Melis](https://dmelis.github.io). 
<!-- Broadly, I am interested in making language models more useful and controllable. I am also interested in understanding and analysis.-->
<!-- I am also interested in robust evaluation and analysis.-->

Over the past few years, I walked my first baby steps as a researcher owing to some wonderful people and collaborations. Most recently, I was a pre-doctoral researcher at Google DeepMind, working on modularizing LLMs with [Partha](https://parthatalukdar.github.io/) and [Prateek](https://www.prateekjain.org/). Before that, I pursued my bachelor's thesis research with [Yonatan](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~belinkov/) at the Technion in Israel studying the [information-theoretic properties of neural networks](https://rachitbansal.github.io/information-measures). Before that, I was a research intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/)'s Media and Data Science Research Lab, where I worked on [commonsense reasoning for large language models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.83/).

I was fortunate to collaborate with [Danish](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/) on [evaluating neural attribution methods](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00465/110436/Evaluating-Explanations-How-Much-Do-Explanations)[^1]. I also had an amazing time working with [Naomi](https://nsaphra.net/) studying [mode connectivity in loss surfaces](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hY6M0JHl3uL) of language models[^2].

I also spent a couple of wonderful summers as a part of the Google Summer of Code program with the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu/)). Here, I was advised by [Jacob](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/person/jacob-dahl) and [Niko](https://www.english-linguistics.de/nschenk/).
