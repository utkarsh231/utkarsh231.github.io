I am Utkarsh Prakash Srivastava, a Machine Learning Researcher passionate about building systems that connect rigorous mathematics with real-world impact. My research journey began in India, where I worked with [Prof. Palash Goshal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1OTcXoAAAAJ&hl=en) on biomedical imaging problems, learning how machine learning could push the frontiers of healthcare. Later, I was fortunate to spend a summer in Nagoya, Japan, under [Prof. Toshiaki Fujii](https://profs.provost.nagoya-u.ac.jp/html/100001881_en.html), exploring region-of-interest coding for advanced medical image compression. These experiences gave me not just technical depth, but also the joy of working across cultures and disciplines.  

Currently, I am based in New York City as a researcher at NYU Langone Health, where I collaborate with [Dr. Samrachana Adhikari](https://samrachana.com/) and the Targeted Learning Group. Together, we are studying robust statistical inference methods and building AI systems for public health and legal applications.  

Along the way, I have also collaborated with startups, contributing to the development of multimodal legal document intelligence systems, and engaged with communities of researchers worldwide who share the same excitement about deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.  

For me, research has always been about people as much as ideas—mentors who guided me, collaborators who challenged me, and institutions that gave me opportunities to grow. Each step, from India to Japan to the United States, has shaped how I see AI: not just as an algorithm, but as a tool for advancing human understanding and solving meaningful problems.
