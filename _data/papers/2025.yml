  abstract: "findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers."

  title: "Region of Interest based Medical Image Compression"

  abstract: "The vast volume of medical image data necessitates efficient compression techniques to support remote healthcare services. This paper explores Region of Interest (ROI) coding to address the balance between compression rate and image quality. By leveraging UNET segmentation on the Brats 2020 dataset, we accurately identify tumor regions, which are critical for diagnosis. These regions are then subjected to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) for compression, enhancing compression rates while preserving essential diagnostic information. This approach ensures that critical image regions maintain their quality, while non-essential areas are compressed more. Our method optimizes storage space and transmission bandwidth, meeting the demands of telemedicine and large-scale medical imaging. Through this technique, we provide a robust solution that maintains the integrity of vital data and improves the efficiency of medical image handling."

  title: "U-SwinTrans: Automated Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Swin Transformer"

  abstract: "Skin lesions are difficult to segment because of their diverse shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven effective in medical image segmentation, traditional U-shaped networks often struggle to capture global features. To address this, we integrated Swin Transformer Blocks into a U-shaped architecture, enhancing the ability to model both local and global context. Additionally, image preprocessing using DCT, DWT, and FFT was applied to improve input quality. The proposed U-SwinTrans architecture tokenizes preprocessed images into patches, which are processed by the encoder-decoder to learn semantic characteristics crucial for lesion segmentation. A comprehensive evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for accurate and robust skin lesion segmentation."
