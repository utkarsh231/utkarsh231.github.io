  abstract: "Cancer remains a significant global health concern, contributing to a substantial number of fatalities. Specifically, brain cancer entails the abnormal proliferation of cells within or near the brain. Timely detection plays a pivotal role in effective tumor treatment. Machine learning advancements have significantly aided the medical field in diagnosing brain tumors. This study evaluates four popular deep learning algorithms—AlexNet, GoogLeNet, InceptionV3, and ResNet50—using MRI slices to classify tumors into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor categories. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with GoogLeNet achieving the best results. A comparative analysis with state-of-the-art algorithms highlights the enhanced performance of these models for brain cancer classification."
